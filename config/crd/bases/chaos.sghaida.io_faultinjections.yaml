                        MeshFaultAction defines a single HTTP fault injection action applied
                        either to inbound or outbound traffic.

                        Each MeshFaultAction:
                        - targets exactly one traffic direction (INBOUND or OUTBOUND)
                        - affects a bounded percentage of traffic
                        - is independently cleaned up by name
                        - may define multiple HTTP route matches

                        Note: when defining multiple MeshFaultActions within the same FaultInjection,
                        ensure that their route matches do not overlap to avoid conflicting VirtualService rules.
                        This is the operator's responsibility when defining faults.
                        The controller MAY validate for overlapping matches and reject conflicting configurations.

                        Note: when applying outbound faults with sourceSelector,
                        the controller MUST ensure that the affected pods do not exceed blastRadius.maxPodsAffected.
                        If the controller cannot safely estimate the number of affected pods,
                        it MUST abort the experiment to avoid wide-impact chaos.

                        Note: the controller MUST clean up any created or patched VirtualServices
                        when the FaultInjection completes or is cancelled.

                        PodFaultAction defines a single pod-level chaos action.
                        Audit is mandatory: the controller MUST emit events, log, and record the affected pod names in status.
                        Cross-field validation:
                        - FORCEFUL requires gracePeriodSeconds == 0
                        - GRACEFUL requires gracePeriodSeconds > 0
                        PodFaultAction defines how a pod-level fault is applied to Kubernetes workloads.

                        Semantics:

                        - type=POD_DELETE:
                          - Deletes selected pods in the target (graceful or forceful).
                          - The controller MUST record the impacted pod names in status and emit events for auditability.

                        Defaulting:

                        - policy.executionMode defaults to ONE_SHOT.
                        - target.namespace defaults to the FaultInjection namespace (controller-enforced) when omitted.
                        - guardrails.refuseIfPodsLessThan defaults to 1.
                        - guardrails.respectPodDisruptionBudget defaults to true.

                        Admission policy (cross-field invariants; enforced by CRD validation, admission webhook, or controller):

                        - Termination mode and grace period:
                          - When termination.mode=FORCEFUL:
                          - termination.gracePeriodSeconds MUST be 0
                          - When termination.mode=GRACEFUL:
                          - termination.gracePeriodSeconds MUST be > 0

                        - Execution mode and window:
                          - When policy.executionMode=WINDOWED:
                          - window is required
                          - When policy.executionMode=ONE_SHOT (or policy omitted):
                          - window MUST be omitted

                        - Pod selection mode:
                          - When selection.mode=COUNT:
                          - selection.count is required
                          - selection.percent MUST be omitted
                          - When selection.mode=PERCENT:
                          - selection.percent is required (1..100)
                          - selection.count MUST be omitted

                        Safety expectations:

                          - guardrails are mandatory.
                          - selection.maxPodsAffected (if set) acts as an additional per-action cap and is still bounded by
                            spec.blastRadius.maxPodsAffected (if the parent FaultInjection defines it).
